							<h1 class="pink__text">Overview</h1>
							<h2>Project Details: <span class="blueish__text">Developed under Association for Computing Machinery</span></h2>
							<h2>Roles & Responsibilies: <span class="blueish__text">UI/UX Designer, Graphic Designer, Front-End Developer</span></h2>
							<h2>Tools & Technologies: <span class="blueish__text">Figma, Flutter, Firebase, Apple iTunes API, Android Studio</span></h2>

							<h1 class="pink__text">Design Process</h1>
							<p>The project began by analyzing our goals of revolutionizing a new music/social media app 
								and taking branding guidance from already popular companies. The particular fact that drove me 
								to choose our final color palette was the consistency of colors. Most social media and music apps 
								have focused on having a mono theme (using shades of black and white) with a bold accent color to emphasize 
								the primary functions of the app. We chose purple to avoid taking commonly used colors and place a subtle emphasis 
								on the modernity and sleekness of our apps. Our initial draft of wireframes is shown below (feel free to look around at 
								our design process!). </p>

							<h1 class="pink__text">Competitive Analysis</h1>
							<p>For our branding, I chose competitors with slightly similar functionality and palette, as these competitors 
								would be most similar to the eye. I cross-referenced Spotify, Twitter, Youtube Music, and Shazam to review how they 
								utilized color in their apps. For example, Spotify and Shazam rarely use their accent colors (green and blue, respectively) in 
								their overall design, though we associate the key actions and branding with that color. On the contrary, Twitter and Youtube Music 
								can be seen using their accent colors (baby blue and red, respectively) frequently throughout the app. This drew attention to some of 
								the key functionality that set each of them apart as apps. Based on this separation, I chose to follow in line with Twitter and Youtube Music 
								and incorporate our accent color, deep purple, throughout the app in key areas such as navigation, buttons, and interaction.
							</p>

							<p>As for competitors in functionality, I chose competitors based on personal experience and user research. For the most commonly 
								used music apps in our team and community, we had Apple Music and Spotify, and for social media, we had Instagram and BeReal. 
								However, we chose to remove Apple Music from our list, as they serve a more niche group requiring a subscription to use their 
								music services. Additionally, our music functionality utilized Apple iTunes API, so their key benefits were automatically integrated 
								into MyMuse as well. 
							</p>

							<p>Our final lineup was Spotify, BeReal, and Instagram. BeReal has similar interactivity with its user as MyMuse, Spotify is one of the most 
								popular music apps, and Instagram is one of the most popular social media apps with music functionality added in. However, we highlighted 
								how none of these apps addressed the primary features we wanted from a new social media. This included comparing the music functions themselves, 
								being able to interact with posts, and the existing social capabilities. A summarized performance analysis is shown below.

						<h1 class="pink__text">Challenges</h1>

						<h2 class="pink__text">Tech Stack</h2>
						<p>One of the first roadblocks we faced was related to our tech stack. We originally started with JavaScript as our programming language and 
							React Native as our framework, but due to difficulties while setting up our environments (and Dart/Flutter flexibility in mobile apps), we 
							switched to our current tech stack four weeks into our project timeline, which gave us less time to develop MyMuse.
						</p>

						<h2 class="pink__text">Music API Compatibility</h2>
						<p>Many music APIs we found provided documentation for more common languages like Node.js and Python, 
							so it took some time to find proper Flutter documentation to implement a music API into MyMuse.
						</p>

						<h2 class="pink__text">User Data Retrieval</h2>
						<p>In the beginning stages of development, we ran into trouble setting up the structure of the databases 
							MyMuse would have, such as the user database. Important features of a user like a username, profile picture, 
							followers, and following are all stored in their database and we had some trouble with data retrieval and 
							communication with Firebase. These issues pushed back our timeline, as that caused one of our main functionalities 
							to become a setback.
						</p>
						<h2 class="pink__text">Redirecting User Flow</h2>
						<p> Finally, one of the roadblocks the front-end team faced was the user flow. We found that a lot of the original flow 
							we had planned was redundant and easy to navigate to on a page that would typically be accessed by users. We simplified 
							the navigation bar and ensured the adjusted user flow was visible and clickable throughout the app so that we didn’t sacrifice 
							experience for simplicity. 
						</p>

							<h1 class="pink__text">Future Developments</h1>
							<p>First on the agenda is to implement a monthly song-of-the-day playlist, enabling users to see their past month of listening summarized. 
								Next is a mood-based song of the day recommendation–based on the mood reported by the user, MyMuse will be able to suggest music. 
								We also have a planned feature where users will be able to send song recommendations for songs they like directly to their friends. 
								Finally, we aim to implement a feature where each user is given a monthly song color based on the songs you mused that month. 
								For example, if a user posted more sad songs that month their monthly color would be blue. 
							</p>
							<h1 class="pink__text">Personal Takeaways</h1>
							<p>As the primary designer of the branding and wireframes, I initially learned Figma by practicing with mobile apps, so I didn’t struggle 
								with transitioning between designing for a web app to designing for a mobile app. Having started with React and web apps for development, 
								though, I hit a learning curve initially with the nested structure that Flutter uses compared to React Native’s HTML-based structure. That 
								being said, I had very good documentation to support my learning, and I was able to code the loading screen, navigation bar, add and 
								request friends page, and user profile page.
