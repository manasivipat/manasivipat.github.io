							<h1 class="pink__text">Overview</h1>
							<h2>Project Details: <span class="blueish__text">Developed as marketing officer/web developer of Women Mentoring Women in Engineering</span></h2>
							<h2>Roles & Responsibilies: <span class="blueish__text">UI/UX Designer, Full-Stack Web Developer</span></h2>
							<h2>Tools & Technologies: <span class="blueish__text">Figma, React, Node.js, Firebase</span></h2>

							<h1 class="pink__text">Problem</h1>
							<p>Recently, Women Mentoring Women in Engineering rebranded the organization, from the social medias to valuable documents provided externally.
								However, one of the few assets that did not get rebranded was the website. The design was outdated, officer board information had not been updated, 
								and with the growth of the organization, we were missing quite a bit of information that would serve as valuable to website visitors.
								I was tasked, along with the marketing chair and vice president, to redesign the website and include all updated information, including sponsor information,
								mission statements, contact information, and simply enhance the website experience. 
							</p>
							
							<h1 class="pink__text">Design Process</h1>
							<p>Our initial wireframes had little direction apart from our existing branding guidelines, so we were left with a very open scheme. 
								First, we chose to designate our current colors to respective components on our website. We chose to use the pale light-blue color 
								as a background color for our entire website. We utilized the darkest color (indigo) as our text color and a vibrant blue for our primary 
								components, including an announcements bar at the top of the website, the member login button, and any other action buttons. Initially, 
								we designed based on a retro/scrapbook-styled website.
							</p>

						</center>			
						<p>However, due to the lack of flexibility in the design, we chose to follow after our flyers and maintain a simpler design. The new design 
							utilizes the same guidelines but places priority on the color hierarchy and therefore looks much more cohesive.

							<h1 class="pink__text">Challenges</h1>

						<p> One of our primary struggles has been the implementation of the portal and calendar with all events. 
							Initially, the calendar was supposed to pull from an existing API and update at certain times. However, 
							the backing functionality was difficult to implement and we chose to readjust the direction we were taking with it. 
							Our second main challenge has been implementing the portal, as we have multiple elements that require an API or database to pull from.
							The most recent struggle with the portal includes setting up verification to ensure the WMWE members' credentials are secure and the information
							stored in their portal is hidden until proper authentication has been established. On the front-end side, establishing responsiveness
							on the website is an ongoing operation, but most of it has been completed. 
						</p>


							<h1 class="pink__text">Personal Takeaways</h1>
							<p> This was my first project in development and I have been able to grow quite a bit while working with React and Node.js.
								At this point, I'd had minimal experience with applying JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to a project that served a particular
								purpose, as I typically tested my knowledge on practice webpages. I'm grateful to have worked alongside my team and 
								the experience I received while working on this project has helped me in my other projects!
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Current Status: We are cleaning up the front-end of the website and searching for resources that will aid us
									in working on the portal and the databases involved in authentication. We plan to have the website released by
									January 2023!
