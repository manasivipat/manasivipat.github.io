						<h1 class="project__title">WMWE Website</h1>
						<p class="casestudytext">Founded at the University of Texas at Dallas in the summer of 2016, <b style="color:#77AFE4;">Women Mentoring Women in Engineering</b> is a mentoring program 
							that fosters mentorships between students of UTD and working women. Students are paired up with professional women currently working 
							in the technology industry or in academia to be mentored for a semester and build a relationship with those familiar with the working 
							environment.</p>
						<p class="casestudytext" style="padding-bottom: 4rem">
							In an effort to <b style="color:#77AFE4;">improve their online presence and keep up with exponential growth</b>, Women Mentoring Women in Engineering recently 
								underwent a rebranding effort that included updating their social media accounts and valuable documents. However, 
								their website was left behind, with an <b style="color:#77AFE4;">outdated design and incomplete information</b>. As the organization 
								continued to grow, it became clear that the website needed a complete overhaul to provide visitors with all of the necessary 
								information, including <b style="color:#77AFE4;">sponsorship details, mission statements, and contact information.</b>

							<h1 style="font-size: 2.7rem; font-weight: 700; color:white; padding-bottom: 5rem;">How can we revamp the Women Mentoring Women in Engineering website to accommodate their growth, enhance their online presence, and provide visitors with comprehensive information and a better user experience?</h1>

									<!-- <h1 style="font-size: 2.4rem; font-weight: 700; color:white;">What's so complicated about a school club?</h1> -->
									<p class="casestudytext"> 
										After sitting down with my development team, we fully expected to be able to complete this project in a matter of weeks.
										Once we finally got to clicking through the current website, though, we realized we had quite a lot in store for us. Without
										consistent maintenance of the site's content, the website was filled with old information and broken links, and finding
										a place to start was just about as difficult as finding a single page that was up to date.
									</p>

										<h1><i style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 300; color:#77AFE4;">Our old website, featuring too much whitespace and an officer board long graduated :(</i></h1>
									</center>
									<p class="casestudytext" style="padding-bottom: 5rem;">
										So, to start, we decided to pull from our experiences as officers and mentees within the program. Then, we conducted a series of
										interviews with officers, mentees, and mentors to get a better understanding of our updated priorities, and identified 3
										target areas of improvement.
									</p>
							
							<h1 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; color:white; ">ðŸŽ¯ HOW MIGHT WE INCREASE ENGAGEMENT WITH A SINGULAR PLATFORM?</h1>
							<p class="casestudytext">
								Being a marketing officer for a rapidly growing organization is no easy feat. As each new semester rolls around, it brings 
								with it a fresh batch of mentees, mentors, and events that require weekly promotion. Juggling so many moving parts can make 
								it all too easy to forget important tasks, like posting flyers on LinkedIn or keeping in touch with potential new members through 
								Instagram DMs. Unfortunately, this problem doesn't just affect our officer board â€” it also has negative consequences for our mentees. 
								Many interested new members and <b style="color:#77AFE4;">current members have been driven away by the sheer difficulty of trying to 
								keep up with content</b> spread across multiple platforms.

							</center>

							<h1 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; color:white; ">ðŸŽ¯ HOW MIGHT WE PERSONALIZE THE MENTORSHIP EXPERIENCE USING OUR WEBSITE?</h1>
							<p class="casestudytext">
								With WMWE's rapid growth, keeping track of the old and the new is something that our old website did not do well. As a
								very niche organization, we strived to create personal connections with mentors and mentees alike, but <b style="color:#77AFE4;">
								with no way to easily access a list of current members, it was difficult to keep track of who was who</b>. For our mentors, we had to rely on
								Linkedin profiles and their short application responses, while for our mentees, we had almost nothing to go off of apart from
								their names and majors. Without any of this information, the disconnect throughout WMWE became prominent and it turned out to be hard
								â€” for not only us, but mentors and mentees â€” to pick up a conversation with someone who they had no knowledge of. Many mentors were even remote,
								so being able to connect with them on a personal level was even more difficult when we could hardly find their contact information.

							<h1 style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: 700; color:white; ">ðŸŽ¯ HOW MIGHT WE FACILITATE FASTER COMMUNICATION USING OUR WEBSITE AS AN AVENUE?</h1>
							<p class="casestudytext">
								With WMWE being so involved in the industry <i>and</i> in the student body, we have a strong heirarchy that helps
								us organize different aspects of the program, including outreach, marketing, events, and program coordination.
								However, with so many different people involved in the organization and various individual spreadsheets keeping track
								of endless information, there is no single place where we can communicate to students. What's worse? Our mentees themselves
								didn't know how to reach us directly, and instead communicated through an assigned Mentoring Team Manager, who then had to 
								grab a coordinator's attention, and only <i>then</i> would we as an executive team be able to respond. Many of us <b style="color:#77AFE4;">officers
								went unnoticed as a result</b>, and though it kept our team structured, it also meant <b style="color: #77AFE4;">conflict resolution and necessary communication
								took longer than expected</b>.

							</center>

							<h1 style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 700; color:#77AFE4; ">IDEATION</h1>
							<p class="casestudytext">
								Rather than jumping straight into the design process, we decided to take a step back and understand how we could best ensure
								each problem got an equal amount of attention on the website. We started by creating a flowchart and hashing out the
								<b style="color: #77AFE4;">information architecture</b>.

											<p class="casestudytext" style="width: 35rem">
												One of the major issues both my team and many of the people we surveyed picked up on was the lack 
												of cohesion across our social media platforms. We had a logo, but it was not consistent across all of our platforms,
												and with our old website being created using a website builder, we struggled with being able to use the same fonts and sizes
												for our content. However, with our tech-stack consisting of <b style="color: #77AFE4;">React</b>, we had much more flexibility 
												and were better able to stick to our branding.</p>

							<h1 style="font-size: 1.7rem; font-weight: 700; color:#77AFE4; ">HI-FIDELITY WIREFRAMING</h1>
							<p class="casestudytext">
								Once we fully understood the information architecture, we started to create a set of wireframes for our website. We originally
								tried to stick to our social media branding, which was more playful, and tried to embrace vibrant colors. However, the designs
								we created, from a technical/developer's standpoint, was not at all responsive and not very adaptable for future changes. <br>
								<br>
								We switched gears to a more minimalistic design, which was more adaptable and responsive, and also allowed us to focus on the content
								instead of the design, which had been one of our major priorities in the earlier stages of the project.

							<!-- <h1 class="pink__text">User Research & Persona Analysis</h1>
							<p>Because we already had a set plan for this website, there was not much need to define a set of problems. We had been provided
								a set of goals from the president of WMWE, but even so, I surveyed my teammate to ask her on her perspective of the website and
								what she wanted to get out of it as an executive officer.

							<br>
							</div>
							<p>
								As seen, Vaishu has been a part of the organization in multiple spheres (as an officer in different divisons and a mentee). She brings
								a unique perspective as both someone who uses the website for marketing and as someone who previously used the website to find information
								about WMWE. As an executive officer, her goals are to fix the lack of marketing and event updates and collect all information to be
								hosted in one place, rather than have it spread out across LinkedIn, Instagram, and Linktree. As a mentee, the contact information and
								general goals of the club aren't recent or fleshed-out, so joining becomes a much more complex process as there's no clear mission or understanding of
								membership.
							</p> -->
							
							<!-- <h1 class="pink__text">Design Process</h1>
							<p>Our initial wireframes had little direction apart from our existing branding guidelines, so we were left with a very open scheme. 
								First, we chose to designate our current colors to respective components on our website. We chose to use the pale light-blue color 
								as a background color for our entire website. We utilized the darkest color (indigo) as our text color and a vibrant blue for our primary 
								components, including an announcements bar at the top of the website, the member login button, and any other action buttons. Initially, 
								we designed based on a retro/scrapbook-styled website.
							</p>
							<center>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/firstwireframeswmwe.jpg" alt="" /></span>			
						</center>			
						<p>However, due to the lack of flexibility in the design, we chose to follow after our flyers and maintain a simpler design. The new design 
							utilizes the same guidelines but places priority on the color hierarchy and therefore looks much more cohesive.

							<h1 class="pink__text">Challenges</h1>

						<p> One of our primary struggles has been the implementation of the portal and calendar with all events. 
							Initially, the calendar was supposed to pull from an existing API and update at certain times. However, 
							the backing functionality was difficult to implement and we chose to readjust the direction we were taking with it. 
							Our second main challenge has been implementing the portal, as we have multiple elements that require an API or database to pull from.
							The most recent struggle with the portal includes setting up verification to ensure the WMWE members' credentials are secure and the information
							stored in their portal is hidden until proper authentication has been established. On the front-end side, establishing responsiveness
							on the website is an ongoing operation, but most of it has been completed. 
						</p>


							<h1 class="pink__text">Personal Takeaways</h1>
							<p> This was my first project in development and I have been able to grow quite a bit while working with React and Node.js.
								At this point, I'd had minimal experience with applying JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to a project that served a particular
								purpose, as I typically tested my knowledge on practice webpages. I'm grateful to have worked alongside my team and 
								the experience I received while working on this project has helped me in my other projects!
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>Current Status: We are cleaning up the front-end of the website and searching for resources that will aid us
									in working on the portal and the databases involved in authentication. We plan to have the website released in
									Spring 2023!
