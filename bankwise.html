							<h1 class="pink__text">Overview</h1>
							<h2>Project Details: <span class="blueish__text">Developed during HackUTD IX (1,000+ participants, 191 teams), won Best Design </span></h2>
							<h2>Roles & Responsibilies: <span class="blueish__text">UI/UX Designer</span></h2>
							<h2>Tools & Technologies: <span class="blueish__text">Figma, React Native, Expo, Capital One API</span></h2>

							<h1 class="pink__text">Prompt</h1>
							<p>At HackUTD, we were given multiple prompts to structure our app around. We chose to do the following: </p>
							<blockquote><b>"Create the best financial hack. Money impacts much of our lives and we would like to promote change for good." (Capital One)</b></blockquote>
							<blockquote><b>"Use technology to design a creative solution to a problem that your community currently faces." (State Farm)</b></blockquote>
							<blockquote><b>"What enhancements or improvements can be made to optimize our end-user experience?" (RingCentral)</b></blockquote>

							<h1 class="pink__text">Solution</h1>
							<p>Our idea stemmed from our personal experiences. These days, students must juggle being financially responsible 
								along with the various commitments that come with academics and our career development. With having to manage multiple bank accounts 
								for our various needs and the rising rates of financial advisors, there's no good solution in the market to solve this problem! 
								From this, we developed a solution that allows users to keep track of their bank accounts, credit cards, and past financial statements 
								all in one app. With enhanced security and specifically-designed functionality, we ensure that our smart solution is also as safe as ever.
								Furthermore, this app would be a key integation with RingCentral or any other multi-functional platform, so that large organizations or 
								companies can take advantage of Bankwise to simplify the management of business finances. 
							</p>
							
							<h1 class="pink__text">Design Process</h1>
							<p>We developed Bankwise from the bottom up. We started with the basics and developed high-fidelity wireframes that we adjusted 
								continuously according to time constraints and framework limitations. In order to develop branding to even begin, we analyzed our 
								competitors and implemented consistent patterns that we noticed across multiple financial service apps. However, we implemented a 
								more modern and simplified approach to our app as we wanted these wireframes to reflect our main end goal: simplicity. Our app was 
								coded using React Native. Because many of the elements in our design were vectors, we imported many of our assets as PNG files in 
								order to ensure high resolution across platforms. Additionally, due to the multi-use nature of this app, we implemented stack navigation 
								in order to easily complete user flow. </p>

						<h1 class="pink__text">Challenges</h1>

						<p> For our backend, we faced many difficulties in working with API as we are not as experienced with it. 
							Our app was built to simply call on an API from each banker and retrieve data about our user's bank account; however, 
							the Capital One API's complexity made it difficult to pull basic information, especially as novice backend developers. 
							We chose to take inspiration from the API and develop a more simplified one for the purpose of this app. In the future, 
							though, we definitely plan to delve deeper into the Capital One API and properly integrate it with the functionality of our app. 
							Implementing navigation was a challenge that our front-end team had problems with. We began with attempting tab navigation between pages, 
							but we continuously ran into errors and despite debugging consistently, we weren't able to resolve the errors that came up. With the time constraint, 
							we switched over to stack navigation. Due to the learning curve, we were only able to implement partial navigation, but we have done our best to ensure 
							that this navigation is simple and easy to access so that our navigation bar doesn't become an overwhelming obstacle in the user experience of this app.

						</p>

							<h1 class="pink__text">Future Developments</h1>
							<p>In terms of future developments, we would like to keep the simplicity of the app while allowing users to access it more and more as we 
								continue to develop updates. Sometime in the future, we would like to be able to integrate an even more simplified version of the app 
								into a multi-tool platform such as RingCentral, so that we are able to come to our users rather than them having to download yet another app. 
								Additionally, we'd like to expand internationally--by connecting with banks across the world, BankWise will serve as a hub for everything 
								related to financials. This will come with added functionality for a currency conversion (according to current rates) and a section for 
								documentation to aid users with international bank accounts in streamlining their banking process.
							</p>
							<h1 class="pink__text">Personal Takeaways</h1>
							<p> As the UI/UX designer for Bankwise, I was very proud of our front-end; the design and ease of use with each account was simple and quite easy to access!
								This was one of the few times I've been able to work with a prompt to develop a solution to a problem, and I was highly inspired by existing apps
								with outstanding UI and my personal banking apps. Over the course of the 24 hours, I got to analyze the apps I use on a daily basis and build a solution
								that is both personalized and inclusive to even the least tech-savvy users.<br><br>
								The different features added and the wireframes give Bankwise ease of access for every functionality. In our front-end team, 
								we learned about different types of navigation and the benefits and issues that can come up while implementing it. 
								We'll be able to make a more educated decision on how to best go about implementing user flow and providing an overall 
								good experience with our app in the future!
								For our back-end, we are very proud to have been able to work with APIs in a much more involved context. We were able to 
								learn more about Capital One's API and though we didn't have the time to implement it, this has set our app up because we 
								now know what our current app is capable of handling and given more time, we will definitely be able to integrate a more complex API.
