							<h1 class="pink__text">Overview</h1>
							<h2>Project Details: <span class="blueish__text">Developed during HackUTD IX (1,000+ participants, 191 teams), won Best Design </span></h2>
							<h2>Roles & Responsibilies: <span class="blueish__text">UI/UX Designer</span></h2>
							<h2>Tools & Technologies: <span class="blueish__text">Figma, React Native, Expo, Capital One API</span></h2>

							<h1 class="pink__text">Prompt</h1>
							<p>At HackUTD, we were given multiple prompts to structure our app around. We chose to do the following: </p>
							<blockquote><b>"Create the best financial hack. Money impacts much of our lives and we would like to promote change for good." (Capital One)</b></blockquote>
							<blockquote><b>"Use technology to design a creative solution to a problem that your community currently faces." (State Farm)</b></blockquote>
							<blockquote><b>"What enhancements or improvements can be made to optimize our end-user experience?" (RingCentral)</b></blockquote>

							<h1 class="pink__text">Solution</h1>
							<p>Our idea stemmed from our personal experiences. These days, students must juggle being financially responsible 
								along with the various commitments that come with academics and our career development. With having to manage multiple bank accounts 
								for our various needs and the rising rates of financial advisors, there's no good solution in the market to solve this problem! 
								From this, we developed a solution that allows users to keep track of their bank accounts, credit cards, and past financial statements 
								all in one app. With enhanced security and specifically-designed functionality, we ensure that our smart solution is also as safe as ever.
								Furthermore, this app would be a key integation with RingCentral or any other multi-functional platform, so that large organizations or 
								companies can take advantage of Bankwise to simplify the management of business finances. 
							</p>
							
							<h1 class="pink__text">Design Process</h1>
							<p>We developed Bankwise from the bottom up. We started with the basics and developed high-fidelity wireframes that we adjusted 
								continuously according to time constraints and framework limitations. In order to develop branding to even begin, we analyzed our 
								competitors and implemented consistent patterns that we noticed across multiple financial service apps. However, we implemented a 
								more modern and simplified approach to our app as we wanted these wireframes to reflect our main end goal: simplicity. Our app was 
								coded using React Native. Because many of the elements in our design were vectors, we imported many of our assets as PNG files in 
								order to ensure high resolution across platforms. Additionally, due to the multi-use nature of this app, we implemented stack navigation 
								in order to easily complete user flow. </p>

						<h1 class="pink__text">User Research & Persona Analysis</h1>
						<p>To start with developing a target set of problems to solve, I conducted 2 user interviews to form 2 different personas 
							in order to frame the user base that we would be attempting to develop for. To ensure our team represented multiple communities, 
							I reached out to an adult and a college student to see what they would be seeking in a financial app that would aggregate their financial data.
						</p>
						<div class="bankwise__personas">
						</center><span class="image main"><img src="images/bankwisepersona1.png" alt="" /></span>
						<br>
						</center><span class="image main"><img src="images/bankwisepersona2.png" alt="" /></span>
						</div>
						<br>
						<h2 class="pink__text">Chandana</h2>
						<p> Chandana, our first persona, was part of a double income household with plenty of expendable money. However, this also meant using 
							said salary to contribute to larger investments such as any outstanding loans and college expenses for her older daughter. Furthermore, 
							due to moving states in 2014, she no longer had access to the banker she used to use, as they do not have offices in Texas. She primarily 
							relies on paperwork being sent to her address to keep track of any major updates or issues related to her account because of the lack of 
							statement organization online. Therefore, her priorities in terms of finances would lie in having documents be easy to access with the ability to filter						
							by bank account or banker and convenient access.
						</p>

						<h2 class="pink__text">Shaz</h2>
						<p> Shaz, our second persona, contrasted with Chandana greatly. As a college student, his expenditures were covered under allowances
							and included groceries and personal spending, therefore a much smaller scope. However, he is also in the early stages of financial independence
							and is therefore still working on his credit, which requires multiple bank accounts as each bank provides unique rewards for college
							students attempting to be more financially sound. With plenty of assignments and extracurriculars to keep track of, Shaz prioritizes
							an app that would allow him to not multitask by providing information in one place, and the ability to keep track of transactions made
							on each account so that he can hold himself responsible for spending. 
						</p>

						<br>
						<h2 class="pink__text">Research â†’ Solution</h2>
						<p>
							With these personas in mind, we framed Bankwise in the context of making banking across multiple platforms easier. Our
							features included being able to view a list of bank accounts, each containing their identifying number, routing number (both with their own encryption as
							a result of API security), transaction history, and current balance. From there, we also included a section to view the list of cards under a user's name,
							both debit and credit. Finally, we also added a 'Statements' section, where users could view all their statements, with functionality to allow them to filter
							based on their needs (i.e. filter by bank name, type of account, date of statement, etc.). In this case, Bankwise is more of a portfolio than an online wallet--
							we intended on Bankwise being a simpler way to view financial information side by side, though transaction functionality is on the list of future developments.
						</p>

						<h1 class="pink__text">Design Handoff</h1>
						<p>
							As I took on a stronger role in design, I was also in charge of prepping the product wireframes for actual development.
							Throughout the project, I checked in with our team regarding the design of the product, and we ensured consistent communication
							regarding the ability to implement more complex features such as side-scrolling, given that we were somewhat novice developers
							with a wide range of features to implement in under 24 hours. Because of the time crunch, I worked one step ahead of our front-end developer,
							creating wireframes and testing usability while he focused on coding out the wireframes I had previously made. Due to lack of time, 
							our handoff was more informal-- I focused on ensuring the branding and overall wireframes were agreed upon as I expanded our design to include
							all the features we desired.
						</p>

						<h1 class="pink__text">Usability Testing</h1>
						<p>
							Though we had a limited scope of users to go off of, given that we were under heavy location constraints, we asked the teams
							we shared a room with to contribute to ensuring our product was easy-to-navigate and its purpose was clear. We surveyed over 7-8
							hackers and received valuable feedback on the navigation, whitespace, and even the basic functionalities of the app. Towards the end
							of our project, we also prepped the design for product release to the judges. I developed a simple <a class="graphic__links" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/131mGiLKqYysx9oAP1ZnkmTjC3PQxaUASguWFHEm4gLE/edit?usp=sharing">slidedeck</a> that served as the backdrop for
							our app demo, which allowed me to learn more about what to prioritize within the project when trying to appeal to judges.
							We received commendations from industry judges, design organization executives, and UTD faculty for the ease and visual appeal
							of our user experience!
						</p>

						<h1 class="pink__text">Challenges in Development</h1>

						<p> For our backend, we faced many difficulties in working with API as we are not as experienced with it. 
							Our app was built to simply call on an API from each banker and retrieve data about our user's bank account; however, 
							the Capital One API's complexity made it difficult to pull basic information, especially as novice backend developers. 
							We chose to take inspiration from the API and develop a more simplified one for the purpose of this app. In the future, 
							though, we definitely plan to delve deeper into the Capital One API and properly integrate it with the functionality of our app. 
							Implementing navigation was a challenge that our front-end team had problems with. We began with attempting tab navigation between pages, 
							but we continuously ran into errors and despite debugging consistently, we weren't able to resolve the errors that came up. With the time constraint, 
							we switched over to stack navigation. Due to the learning curve, we were only able to implement partial navigation, but we have done our best to ensure 
							that this navigation is simple and easy to access so that our navigation bar doesn't become an overwhelming obstacle in the user experience of this app.
						</p>


							<h1 class="pink__text">Future Developments</h1>
							<p>In terms of future developments, we would like to keep the simplicity of the app while allowing users to access it more and more as we 
								continue to develop updates. Sometime in the future, we would like to be able to integrate an even more simplified version of the app 
								into a multi-tool platform such as RingCentral, so that we are able to come to our users rather than them having to download yet another app. 
								Additionally, we'd like to expand internationally--by connecting with banks across the world, Bankwise will serve as a hub for everything 
								related to financials. This will come with added functionality for a currency conversion (according to current rates) and a section for 
								documentation to aid users with international bank accounts in streamlining their banking process.
							</p>
							<h1 class="pink__text">Personal Takeaways</h1>
							<p> As the UI/UX designer for Bankwise, I was very proud of our front-end; the design and ease of use with each account was simple and quite easy to access!
								This was one of the few times I've been able to work with a prompt to develop a solution to a problem, and I was highly inspired by existing apps
								with outstanding UI and my personal banking apps. Over the course of the 24 hours, I got to analyze the apps I use on a daily basis and build a solution
								that is both personalized and inclusive to even the least tech-savvy users.<br><br>
								The different features added and the wireframes give Bankwise ease of access for every functionality. In our front-end team, 
								we learned about different types of navigation and the benefits and issues that can come up while implementing it. 
								We'll be able to make a more educated decision on how to best go about implementing user flow and providing an overall 
								good experience with our app in the future!
								For our back-end, we are very proud to have been able to work with APIs in a much more involved context. We were able to 
								learn more about Capital One's API and though we didn't have the time to implement it, this has set our app up because we 
								now know what our current app is capable of handling and given more time, we will definitely be able to integrate a more complex API.
